# microshell
My uni semester project for the Operating Systems subject (06-DSOPLI0)<br>
The goal was to create an OS shell that had a min of 2 custom commands and could launch programs in PATH.
Got the max grade for this beauty, well deserved if I do say so myself.<br>
It handles input on the level of characters and handles signals like arrow keys and ^C<br>
